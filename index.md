## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UNC-Chapel Hill, focusing on Machine Learning.

I received my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from Dickinson College. At Dickinson, I have worked with Prof. [John MacCormick](https://www.dickinson.edu/johnmaccormick) on various projects in object detection and computer graphics.

Previously, I have also been an intern at [UIUC (CSL)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj3tPnMnI2HAxV0sFYBHTMuAWEQFnoECBUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcsl.illinois.edu%2F&usg=AOvVaw0a-D2sSwd5gmnFZF-nLhNW&opi=89978449), and I was a community researcher at [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.com/research).
